        "Panchatantra": {
            "Discord among Friends":"Once upon a time, Amarasakti ruled the city-state of Mahilaropyam in the south of India. He had three witless sons who became a matter of endless worry for him. Realizing that his sons had no interest in learning, the king summoned his ministers and said:“You know I am not happy with my sons. According to men of learning an unborn son and a stillborn son are better than a son who is a dimwit. What good is a barren cow? A son who is stupid will bring dishonour to his father. How can I make them fit to be my successors? I turn to you for advice.”One of the ministers suggested the name of Vishnu Sharman, a great scholar enjoying the respect of hundreds of his disciples. “He is the most competent person to tutor your children. Entrust them to his care and very soon you will see the change.”The king summoned Vishnu Sharman and pleaded with him “Oh, venerable scholar, take pity on me and please train my sons into great scholars and I will make you the lord of hundred villages.”Vishnu Sharman said “Oh, king, listen to my pledge. Hundred villages do not tempt me to vend learning. Count six months from today. If I do not make your children great scholars, you can ask me to change my name.”The king immediately called his sons and handed them to the care of the learned man. Sharman took them to his monastery where he started teaching them the five strategies (Panchatantra).Keeping his word, he finished the task the king entrusted him in six months. Since then, Panchatantra became popular all over the world as children's guide in solving problems of life.Now begins the Loss of Friends (first of the five strategies) series. These are stories that figure in a dialogue between two jackals named Karataka and Damanaka.Long, long ago, a merchant named Vardhaman lived in a town in the south of India. As he was resting on his bed one day it struck him that money was the axis of the world and that the more he had of it the more he would be powerful. Even enemies seek the friendship of a rich man, he told himself. The old become young if they have riches and the young become old if they do not have wealth. Business is one of the six ways that help man amass wealth. This was his logic.Mobilizing all his wares, Vardhaman set out on an auspicious day for Madhura in search of markets for his goods. He began his travel in a gaily-decorated cart drawn by two bullocks. On the way, tired of the long haul, one of the bullocks named Sanjeevaka collapsed in the middle of a jungle near river Jamuna. But the merchant continued his journey asking some of his servants to take care of the animal. But the servantsabandoned the bullock soon after their master had left. Joining him later, they told him that the bullock was dead.In fact, Sanjeevaka was not dead. Feeding on the abundant fresh and tender grass in the forest, he regained strength and began to merrily explore the jungle, dancing and singing in joy. In the same forest lived Pingalaka, the lion. Sanjeevaka, content with his new life in the jungle would waltz and sing uproariously with joy. One day, Pingalaka and other animals were drinking water in the Jamuna when the lion heard the frightening bellow of the bullock. In panic, the lion withdrew into the forest and sat deeply lost in thought and surrounded by other animals.Sensing the predicament of their king, two jackals, Karataka and Damanaka, sons of two dismissed ministers, were clueless as to what had happened to their king.“What could have happened to the lord of the forest,asked Damanaka.Why should we poke our nose into affairs that are not our concern? Haven't you heard the story of the monkey which pulled out the wedge from the log,asked Damanaka.Sounds interesting. Why don't you tell me what happened to the monkey,pleaded Damanaka.Now, listen,said Damanaka and began narrating the story of the monkey.",
            "Gaining Friends":"Even without the wherewithal Learned men and intellectuals Achieve what they want like The crow, the rat, the deer and the turtle.Now the story. There was a city called Mahilaropyam in the south not far off from where was a large banyan tree. Many species of birds came there to eat the tree's fruit. In thehollow of the great tree lived poisonous reptiles like snakes and scorpions. Travelers found the tree a great shelter in their journeys.A crow called Laghupatanaka made this tree his home. As he was flying one day towards the city for collecting food, he sighted a hunter carrying a net and approaching the tree like a messenger of death. The crow at once sensed danger and, sure that the hunter came to trap the birds on the tree, told all the birds,“Friends, this wicked hunter have seeds in his bag that he will scatter to lure you. don't trust him and avoid the seeds like poison.” The hunter came, sowed the seeds and spread the net. He left the spot and sat elsewhere not to arouse the suspicion of the birds. Warned by Laghupatanaka, the birds stayed away from the seeds as though they were poisonous berries.Meanwhile, Chitragriva, king of doves, saw the seeds from a distance and landed there with his retinue of one thousand doves. They came to eat the seeds ignoring the warnings of Laghupatanaka and soon the hunter spread his net and trapped all of them. That is why elders have said that fools can never foresee peril. People often lose sense when danger lurks in the corner.Chitragriva and his retinue, however, kept their cool in the face of danger. He appealed to his friends not to panic. Elders have said that they tide over dangers, who are not scared by crisis. “Let us fly together and land elsewhere where the hunter cannot reach us. We can then plan a strategy to get out of this net. If we don't fly now, we are all doomed,” said Chitragriva. Thereupon, all of them flew together.The hunter followed the flight of the doves and looking upwards chanted, “They are flying together. But the moment there is a break in their unity they will crash to the ground.” Laghupatanaka, the crow, also followed the flying doves to see what they would do. When he lost sight of the birds, the hunter gave up and went home ruing that he had lost his net also.When he was sure that the hunter had failed to chase them, the king of the doves told his friends, “The hunter has disappeared. Let us all now fly towards Mahilaropyam where I have a friend Hiranyaka, who is a rat. He is our only hope. It is only a friend who will come to the aid of those in trouble.” The birds, heeding the advice of the king, flew to the fort of Hiranyaka in Mahilaropyam.Standing outside the fort, Chitragriva shouted,“O friend, come quickly. We are in great trouble.”Without coming out, Hiranyaka shouted back, “Who are you sir and what do you want from me? What is the kind of trouble that is bothering you? Let me know.”“I am your friend Chitragriva, king of the doves. Come out soon.”Hiranyaka came out and was happy to see Chitragriva with his retinue and asked what the matter was. The king of the doves said,“Whatever man does for whatever reasons,in whatever manner and wherever in his last birth. He reaps the consequences for the same reasons, in the same manner and in the same place.”“All of us are trapped in this net because of our weakness for food. Come at once and free us from this trap,” urged Chitragriva.Hiranyaka said, “It is rightly said that a bird can recognize food from fifty miles but cannot see the danger lurking next to him.”After delivering this sermon, the rat set out to free Chitragriva first. But the king of doves pleaded with him to first liberate his friends. The rat was angry and reminded Chitragriva that it was fair that the king became free first and then the servants. “No, it is not like that,” countered Chitragriva. “They are all dedicated to my service and have left their families behind to come with me. I have to repay that debt,” he said.Pleased with his friend's love for his servants, Hiranyaka said, “Friend, I know the duties of a king. I was only testing you. I will free everyone now. This will win more doves for your retinue.” With the help of his servants, the rat then bit off the entire net and all the doves came out. Hiranyaka saw off Chitragriva and retinue and went back into his fort.Seeing the whole drama of Hiranyaka liberating Chitragriva and his friends, Laghupatanaka, the crow, thought, “I don't trust anyone. On top of it, I have a fickle mind. I will seek his friendship. Our ancestors have always said that even if a wise man has everything he needs, he should still seek friends. Even if all the rivers flow into the Sea, the Sea still waits for the Moon to come out.",
            "Of Crows and Owls":"Trust not even a close friend Who earlier was your enemy.This is the story of how the crows burnt the home of a trusting pack of owls.Once upon a time all the crows in a town called Mahilaropya made a huge banyan tree their home. The tree had hundreds of branches. Their king, known as Meghavarna, set up strong fortifications to ensure security for his brood. Similarly, the owls of the town made a nearby cave their colony. They also had a king, called Arimardana, who ruled with the help of a strong and cunning army.The owl king kept a close eye on the banyan tree and on account of previous enmity killed every night any crow he sighted outside the tree. Slowly, the owl king managed to kill all crows that could be seen outside the tree. That is why wise men had always said that whoever neglects disease or the enemy perishes in their hands.Alarmed at the loss of his flock, Meghavarna assembled his ministers and asked them to prepare a plan to fight the owls. He placed before them six strategies and asked them to name the best of the six. The first minister suggested compromise as a tactic because one had first to survive to gather strength and later destroy the enemy. The elders have said,“Bend to the enemy when he is strong Attack him when he is vulnerable.Don't wage a war if it doesn't bring Power, or wealth or friendship.”The second minister ruled out compromise and offered trickery as a formula. He cited the example of how Bheema in the Mahabharata had killed Keechaka in the disguise of a woman. He also quoted elders saying,“Never accept peace with An enemy who is not just For, he will break his word And stab you in the back.”The minister referred to the learned as saying that it is easy to defeat an enemy who is a tyrant, a miser, an idler, a liar, a coward and a fool. Words of peace will only inflame an enemy blinded by anger.The third minister said, “O lord, our enemy is not only strong but also wicked. Neither compromise nor trickery will work with him. Exile is the best way. We shall wait and strike when the enemy becomes weak.”“Neither peace nor bravado Can subdue a strong enemy Where these two do not work Flight is the best alternative.”The fourth minister opposed all these tactics and suggested the king of crows should stay in his own fort, mobilize support from friends and then attack the enemy. He quoted the learned as saying,“A king who flees is like A cobra without fangs. A crocodile in water Can haul an elephant.”Therefore, the minister said, “An ally is what wind is to fire. The king must stay where he is and gather allies for support.”The fifth minister offered a strategy similar to that of the fourth and said, “Stay in your fort and seek the help of an ally stronger than the enemy. It also pays to form an axis of less strong allies.”After listening to all the ministers, Meghavarna turned to the wisest and senior most among his counsels, Sthirajeevi, and asked him for his advice. The wise man told Meghavarna,“Oh, king of crows, this is the time to use duplicity to finish the enemy. You can thus keep your throne.” “But learned sir, we have no idea of where Arimardana lives and of what his failings are.”“That is not difficult. Send your spies and gather information on the key men advising the king of owls. The next step is to divide them by setting one against the other.”“Tell me why did the crows and owls fall out in the first place,” asked Meghavarna.Sthirajeevi said, “That is another story. Long, long ago all the birds in the jungle—swans, parrots, cranes, nightingales, owls, peacocks, pigeons, pheasants, sparrows, crows etc.—assembled and expressed anguish that their king Garuda had become indifferent to their welfare and failed to save them from poachers.Believing that people without a protector were like passengers in a ship without a captain, they decided to elect a new king. They chose an owl as their king.As the owl was being crowned, a crow flew into the assembly and asked them why and what they were celebrating. When the birds told him the details, the crow told them, the owl is a wicked and ugly bird and it is unwise to choose another leader when Garuda is still alive. To crush enemies it is enough if you mentioned Garuda's name or for that matter the name of anyone who is great. That was how the hares managed to live happily by taking the name of the moon.”The birds asked the visiting crow, “Tell us how this has happened.”“I will tell you,” said the crow and began telling them the story of the hares and the elephants.",
            "The Croc and The Monkey":"Raktamukha was a monkey living on a blackberry tree near the coast. That tree was always full of fruits. One day a crocodile named Karalamukha came out of the waters and loitering on the sands came to the tree. Seeing the croc, the monkey said, “O croc, you are my guest. I will feed you with these delicious blackberries. Enjoy the fare. The learned have said,“That man is blessed who hosts A lover or an enemy or a fool. Angels will desert the home That fails to host a guest.”The monkey then gave the crock a lot of berries. After he had his fill, Karalamukha went home. Thereafter, it became a habit with the croc to daily visit Raktamukha, enjoy the fruit he offered, spend time with him discussing the world and then go home.One day, the croc's wife asked her husband, “Where do you get this fruit, they are so sweet. I have never tasted such mouth-watering fruit.”“I have a close friend, a monkey, who gives me the fruit every day,” said the husband.“If the fruit are so sweet, the heart of your friend who eats them everyday must be as delicious as the fruit. Please get his heart for me, if you have love left for me. I will always be young and immortal if I eat that fruit,” said the wife.“My dear, it is improper for you to speak like that. I have accepted him as my brother. It is not possible for me to kill such a host. Please be reasonable. The elders have said,“From mother we get our first relative, A good word brings the second relative Who is more precious than a brother.”Angry, the wife said, “You have never defied my word. It must be a female monkey who is your friend. That's why you are spending so much time with him every day. I have now understood you thoroughly. Your heart is full of that monkey. You are a cheat.”Karalamukha, wanting to pacify his wife, said, ““My dear, why are you angry? I am your most obedient servant and ready to carry out your order at any time.”“No, she is dear to you. If you really love me, why don't you kill her and get me her heart. If you don't get it, I will fast and die,” threatened the wife.Worried, the croc went to the monkey. Seeing that the croc was late for his daily meeting, Raktamukha said, “You are late and do not seem to be cheerful. What's the matter?”“O my friend, how can I tell you what happened at home. My wife is very angry. She told me that I am an ungrateful friend and that every day I eat the fruit you offer but never had the courtesy of inviting you home. You have no redemption; she told me and warned me that if I did not bring you home, I would see her only in the other world. These arguments with her have delayed me. Please come with me. My wife has decorated the house fit to receive you. She has hung welcome buntings at the entrance. She is eagerly waiting for me to bring you home.”The monkey said, “Your wife has said the proper thing. You should leave a man who loves you for your wealth like the spider attracts his prey. She might as well have quoted the elders saying,“Where there is no give and take Where there is no exchange of secrets And of hospitality either.There is no true friendship.”“There is a problem, however. We are all land animals. You live in water. It may not be possible for me to accept your kind invitation. I advise you to bring her here,” said the monkey.“It's really no problem,” said the croc. “Our house is on a sandbank. It's a beautiful place. Sit on my back. I will carry you.”The monkey happily sat on the back of the croc and the journey began. As the croc was entering deep waters, the monkey got scared and told the croc to go slowly.Thinking that the monkey was his prisoner now, Karalamukha told Raktamukha, “It is now safe to tell you our plan. My wife wanted me to create trust in you first and persuade you to accept our invitation and then kill you so that we may have the good fortune of feasting on your heart.”With great presence of mind, the monkey said, “My friend, if this is what you and your wife wanted, why didn't you tell me in the beginning itself? My heart is safely stored in the burrow of the tree. What is the use of your taking me home without my heart? Let us go back. There is nothing happier for me than giving my heart to your wife.” Happy, the croc turned back and brought the monkey to the shore.The monkey at once leapt to the top of the blackberry tree and thought, “We should not trust an untrustworthy person, even if we did, it should not be total. Such trust will destroy us completely. This is a rebirth for me.”The croc was in a hurry and asked the monkey, “What is the delay? Get you heart. My wife will be very happy.”The monkey angrily told him, “You idiot, have you seen anyone who has two hearts? You are ungrateful. Get out of my sight and never come this way again. People who are hungry stoop to any level like Priyadarsana.",
            "Imprudence":"Manibhadra was a merchant living in the southern city of Pataliputra. He was a man of principles who had lost all his wealth. His poverty made him very sad and one night he reflected on his condition and thought:“Neither character nor patience Neither humility nor pedigree Dispels a poor man's gloom.”Even if a man has merit, the pressures of earning a livelihood overshadow such merit. The need to look after the family wears out one's brilliance. A poor man's house is like a sky without stars, a lake without water.“A poor man is shunned even if He has character and pedigree. A wealthy man shines in society Without merit and caste roots.What he does is never shameful But to be poor is always a crime.”After thinking a lot about his condition, Manibhadra decided that death alone could solve his problems. With these thoughts he fell asleep and saw a dream. In his dream, a Jain monk appeared and said, “O merchant, don't give in to self-pity. I am Padmanidhi, the treasure collected by your ancestors. Tomorrow morning when I will visit you in this guise, you will hit my head with a stick and I will turn into gold. You can live happily ever after.”When the merchant woke up next morning he wondered whether what he saw in the dream was real or unreal. “This may not be true. It could just be an illusion because I have been thinking about money all the time,” he thought and remembered the following poem:“Their dreams never come true Who are sick, grief stricken, Lovelorn and infatuated.”Meanwhile, a barber came to the merchant's house because his wife had called him for pedicure. Very soon came the Jain monk who appeared in the merchant's dream. Manibhadra was happy to see him and at once reached for the stick and struck him on his head. The monk turned into a statue of gold. The merchant then gave clothes and money to the barber and told him not to pass this information to anyone.The barber went home and thought, “if a monk turns into gold if I strike him, I will invite all the monks and kill them and I can have lots of money.” He passed the night with great difficulty. Next morning he went to the Jain monastery, went round its precincts three times and prostrated before the idol of Jinendra and sang the praise of the Jains thus:“Victory to the Jain monks Who keep lust and love at bay Who turn the mind into a desert Where desire does not grow.Blessed are the hands that worship The enlightened Jinendra and blessed is the tongue That praises the great Saint.”After this prayer, the barber met the chief monk and knelt before him seeking his blessings. The monk blessed him and asked the barber the reason that brought him to the monastery. The barber pleaded humbly that the chief monk and others should accept his hospitality.The chief monk said, “O my son, we are not Brahmins who are invited home to be honoured. We are mendicants who visit Jain homes and accept what is necessary to keep us alive. Please go away and don't embarrass me.”Disappointed, the barber said, “O great seer, I have made all preparations to receive you. Yet I cannot press you. You will do what you think is best.”The barber went home and kept a stick ready after checking the exits of the house. He went to the monastery again and stood there pleading with the monks to accept his offerings. Taking pity on the barber, the monks agreed to visit his home. The elders have rightly said:“Man becomes old and infirm, Loses his hair and teeth and Cannot even hear and see properly. Everything in his body Degenerates but not desire.”When the poor monks trooped into his house, the barber closed all the exits and began assaulting them. Some of them died while some were crying with pain. The sheriff, passing by, heard this commotion and asked his men to immediately find out what was happening. The men saw what the barber had done and presented him before a magistrate. The barber admitted that he had killed some of the monks. The magistrate ordered that the barber be impaled.The judges then said that no one should do like the barber without understanding the situation for the learned have said that he who does things without discretion or prudence regrets his action like the Brahmin's wife.",

Rama, Lakshmana and Sita dwelt happily in the forest like devas' or gandharvas.->King Dasaratha's Kingdom and capital:The earth consisting of seven islands has been under one ruler since the time of those kings descended from Manu,who were ever victorious. Among those mighty monarchs was Sagara followed by his sixty thousand sons who hollowed out the ocean. This classic Ramsyana contains the history of the House of Sagara, founded by Ikshwaku. This Rams-Katha' will be recited from beginning to end-let all listen to it with faith.On the banks of the river Sarayu, there was a great and prosperous country named Koshala, inhabited by contented people. In it was the city of Ayodhya, famous in the three worlds, founded by the renowned Manu, a lotd among men.The city's thorougfares extended for sixty miles ; its beauty was enhanced by streets admirably planned, the principal highways being sprinkled with water and strewn with flowers. King Dasaratha protected the city as Maghavan protects Amaravati.->The Dhasaratha's sons are born and grow to manhoodwhen the sacrifice of King Dasaratha had been brought to a successful conclusion, the gods, receiving their due portions,returned to their abode.The world-honoured Lord of the World, endowed with divine attributes, Shri Ramachandra was born of the womb of Kaushalya. The Promoter of the glory of the House of Ikshwaku, the blessed Lord Vishnu was born as a son of Queen Kaushalya.The hero of the realm of truth, Bharata, was born of Queen Kaikeyi. Possessed of every grace, he was endowed with a quarter of the glory of Shri Vishnu.Sumitra gave birth to Lakshmana and Shatrughna, heroes skilful in the wielding of weapons and also partaking of Shri Vishnu's glory. ->Ramachandra and Lakshmana set forth with VishwamitraINSTRUCTED by Shri Vasishtha, King Dasaratha with a cheerful countenance sent for Prince Rama and also Prince Lakshmana.At the time of their departure, the Peace Chant was recited by the king, whilst the Guru Vasishtha pronounced the benediction. The illustrious sovereign then smelt the heads' of his sons with joy and delivered them into the care of the sage.->They reach the hermitage of Kama. The two princes, hesring the words of the most generous sage, rose, performed their ablutions, offered ceremonial water to the rising sun, worshipped their ancestors and began to repeat the holy Gayatri.1 Their devotions completed, they offered salutations with great reverence to the distinguished ascetic and stood ready to proceed further. The two princes with Vishwamitra behold the dark forest of Taraka.Vishwamithra seeks to convincee rama that it is his duty to slay Taraka.Having spoken thus, Shri Rama grasped his bow and, twanging the string, filled all the cardinal points with the sound. The denizens of the forest were terrified, and Taraka was overcome with helpless rage. ->Shri Rama is given the celestial weapons Great Prince receive also the mighty Dharma-pasha, the Kala-pasha and the Varuna-pasha and two other maces called Shoshka and Ashani ; the Pinaka weapon, the Narayana weapon and the fire-emitting weapon Agneya. Then the great Vishwamithra turned his face to the east and performed the purificatory rites with joy, conferring on Rama the mantrams for employing the weapons and instructing him in the methods unknown even to the gods. All these weapons did Shri Vishwamitra confer on Rama, aod he, repeating the appropriate mmtrams, caused their presiding deities to appear before him.->Vishwamitra starts out with the two princes to attend king Janaka's sacrifice. The great hero, the ever-cheerful Rama, together with Lakshmana having successfully assisted Shri Vishwamitra, passed the night in the hermitage. Shri Ramachandra and Prince Lakshmana then offered salutations to Shri Vishwamitra and the other rishis, and sat down before them. Thereafter Shri Rama cheerfully enquired :  O Lord, what country is this, covered with verdant groves ? Be gracious enough to relate everything conceruing it.The great ascetic of firm vows, was pleased to hear these words and, sitting amidst the sages, he described the country fully to them. ->Diti undergoes severe austerities for the birth of a son.learning that her children had been slain, Diti was much afflicted and approached her husband Kasyapawith the words : ' O Lord, by thy powerful sons, am I bereft of my children. I desire a son who will be able to destroy Indta, though to this end I must undergo great penance. Such austerities I will perform, if thou wilt grant me a son that is mighty, valorous, strong-willed and firm of purpose. ->Shri Rama liberates Ahalya from Gautama's curse and departs for Mithila Shri Rama entered the hermitage,preceded by the Sage Vishwamitra.There they beheld Abalya, by virtue of her yogic practices. Unperceived by devas, asuras or men, it seemed as if Brahms bad created her with his own bands as a great mistress of occult powers. Resembling the full moon veiled in mist or the rellection of the sun in water or a bright fire wreathed in smoke, by the curse of the Rishi Gautams she remained invisible and thus it was ordained she should remain till she beheld Shri Ramachandra and till that hour, none in the three worlds should look on her.With the deepest reverence did Shri Rama and Lakshmsna touch the feet of Ahalya and she, remembering the words of the Rishi Gautams fell down in devotion before them. Thereafter, she entertained them with dne hospitality, as enjoined in the scriptures, while the two princes acknowledged the honour paid to them. At this moment a rain of flowers fell from the sky, scattered by the gods ; heavenly musicians sang and celestial nympha danced whilst all rejoiced and paid hom&se to Ahalya.  ->king Janaka relates the story of the great bow and the birth of Sita The day dawned peacefully and King Janaka, having performed his morning devotions, called for the two princes and Vishwamitra. Having honoured the sage and the two descendants of the House of Raghu, he said : O Blessed Lord, peace he with thee, what service can I render thee, I am wholly thine.while I was ploughing the earth for a sacrifice, a girl issued therefrom.Being uncovered by the edge of the plough, I named her Sita and she became my daughter. This earth-born girl has grown up under my prorection. For the marriage of my daughter, it was established by me and made known to the kings coming to seek her hand, that I should not bestow her on any prince whose strength had not been fully tried.->The illustrious Rama breaks the bow and is given the Princess Sita in marriage. HEARING the words of King Janaka, Shri Vishwamitra said :- O King, let the bow be shown to Shri Rama.Five hundred men, of great strength, brought the eight-wheeled cart on which the bow was placed. Then, with palms joined in humility, King Janaka spoke to the holy Sage Vishwamitra standing with Rama and Lakshmana : O Holy Lord, this is the bow which has been the object of worship to the kings of the Nimi dynasty and which the monarchs of the earth coming hither have sought to string. Even the gods have not been able to raise, bend or string tbis bow. How, therefore, shonld mortals have the power to do so if the gods have failed ? 0 Great Risbi, behold the bow, let the two princes eumineit.Shri Ramachandra with a slight elfort, seizing the centre of the bow, lifted it up in the presence of thousands of people and without exertion drew it. By the unparalleled strength of the illustrious Rama, the bow broke into two parts and a sound resembling the fall of a thunderbolt rang forth cleaving the mountains asunder and causing the earth to shake, and on this the people on every side fell insensible, save only Vishwamitta, Rama and Lakshmana.After a while, the people being somewhat restored, and the king's misgivings set at reat, he addressed the excellent Sage with humility, saying :  O Blessed Lord, I have witnessed the unparalleled, wonderful and incontestable feat of Shri Ramachandra. My daughter, the Princess Sits, shall obtain Prince Rama as her lord and add to the gloty of my dynasty.",
            "Ayodhya-Kanda":"The hunchback maid, Manthara, informs Queen Kaikeyi of Shri Rama's coming installation At this time, Queen Kaikeyi had a female servant who had accompanied her from the abode of her royal parent and was ever in attendance on the queen. Her name was Manthara.By chance, ascending the balcony of the palace which resembled the full moon, she perceived the capital of Ayodhya adomed with garlands of lotuses and the principal streetS sprinkled with water. Flags were fluttering from the tops of the tall houses, the roads levelled, and the wide streets crowded with people. Holy brahmins carrying auspicious gifts were waiting to offer them to Shri Ramachandra ; the temples were painted white and strains of musical instruments resounded everywhere. Elated by the festivities, joyful crowds were singing the Vedic mantras and not only men but elephants, horses and cattle demonstrated their joy in their own peculiar fashion. Large flags bound with flowers were being carried by joyous citizens wandering here and there. The royal nurse, overcome with joy at that time, told the hunchbacked Manthara of Rama's enthronement. She said:  Tomorrow, at dawn, under the Pushya star, King Dasaratha will install the sinless Rama, the subduer of anger, as Yuvaraja.Hearing the gentle accents of Queen Kaikeyi, Manthara, who was full of cunning, assuming a sorrowful mien and feigning friendship for the queen, spoke bitterly, O Devi, a great calamity bas befallen thee. Hear me ! King Dasaratha is about to proclaim Shri Ramachandra as regent. I am immersed in the bottomless sea of fear ; I am afflicted with pain and sorrow ; I am as if scorched by fire, and for thy good I have come hither. O Kaikeyi, thy woes are my woes, thy sorrows my sorrows, of this I am certain. Hearken ! Thou art the daughter of a great royal House and thou art the favourite of King Dasaratha. Why art thou deceived by his crafty ways ? Outwardly, thy husband appears to be a speaker of truth, but, inwardly, he is a deceitful man. His speech is fair, but his heart is hard. Thy honesty is the cause of thy suffering. Prevailing on thee .by specious words, the king visits thee and speaks insincere words to thee. By delivering the kingdom to Kaushalya's son, he seeks to make her mistress of all. Like an affectionate mother, thou hast nourished in thy lap the enemy that is called thy lord. Thou resemblest the one who pressed a serpent to her bosom deeming it, through illusion, to be her infant. As a snake or an enemy harms the one who has spared him, so has King Dasaratha to-day dealt with thee and thy son. This sinful, deceitful monarch will destroy thee, thy son and thy relatives, who are worthy of happiness, by enthroning Shri Ramachandra. O Thou of Deluded Intellect, ever indifferent to thine own good, hear me, there is yet time. Whatever thou can'st do for thine own advantage perform and thus protect thy son and me.Hearing the words of Manthara, the beautiful queen rose from her couch, like the autumnal moon.Filled with wonder and delight, she took from her person a precious ornament and presented it to the hunchback woman. ->Mantluzra persuades the queen that Bharata should be regent and Prince Rama banished Manthara, casting the jewel away, in disdain, cried:  O Foolish Queen, this is no occasion for rejoicing, dost thou know that thou art about to be submerged in a sea of sorrow ? I cannot but laugh silently at thy folly.Prince Bharata has an equal right to the kingdom with Ramachandra. Rama fears Prince Bharata and, fearing him, seeks to displace him. Laksh· mana, though heir to the throne, is Rama's obedient servant, just as Prince Shatrughna is faithful to Bharata. O Beautiful One, by birth Bharata has a claim to the throne. Traditionally,the kingdom should be his. Shri Rama is well-versed in affairs of state, and acts promptly in his own interests. Knowing the danger threatening Bharata from Rama, I am filled with dread.->Queen Kaikeyi is resolved upon her evil design The face of Queen Kaikeyi flushed with anger, and sighing deeply, she said to Manthara : To-day, I shall indeed banish Rama and ensure thst Bharata be proclaimed regent. O Manthara, how may Bharata become regent, and Rama be deprived of the kingdom ? Kaikeyi, thus prevailed upon to execute the evil design of Manthara and fully prepared to comply with it, followed her counsel as a young chicken follows its mother. Manthara continued to instruct Kaikeyi in the most cruel manner, uttering words hostile to Rama. ->kaikeyi asks for the two boons promised her by the king The queen addressed the great sovereign, Dasaratha, who, overcome with desire, was pierced by the shafts of Kama-deva,and said : Neither am I sick nor has any offered me insult. I harbour a certain ambition which thou can'st fulfil. If thou art willing to accomplish this, then give me thy solemn promise and I will make known its purport to thee. The resplendent monarch, agitated by desire, raising the head of the queen from the ground took her in his arms and answered smilingly :  O Fortunate One, dost thou not know that none is dearer to me than thou, saving that lion among men, Shri Ramachandra. I swear by the invincible Rama, who is even dearer to me than thou, that I will fulfil thy ambition. OKaikeyi, I swear by Rama, without seeing whom I cannot live one hour, that I will execute thy desire. O Dear One, by my oath I have demonstrated to thee the intensity of my love, now tell me what thou dcsirest. Knowing the great love I beat for thee, have no fear ; by my meritorious deeds I declare to thee, I will grant thee what thou asketh.->Shri Ramachandra betrays no sign of distress and prepares for exile The slayer of his foes, Shri Ramachandra, hearing the words of Kaikeyi, keen as the pangs of death, was in no way moved by them, and answered :  Be it so ! To honour the promise made by the king, I will leave for the forest immediately, with matted locks, attired in raiment made of bark, but I desire to know why the illustrious sovereign does not address me ? O Devi, fear not, I vow, in thy presence that I shall dwell in the forest, dressed in bark with matted locks ; rejoice,therefore ! Whatever command the benevolent monarch, ever mindful of my welfare, shall lay upon me, I will gladly execute to please him.Queen Kaikeyi highly pleased by the words uttered by Shri Ramachandra and assured of his exile, urged him to depart.Hearing the words of Shri Ramachandra, the king, speechless and overcome with grief, wept aloud, shedding bitter tears. The most illustrious Rama made obeisance to his father lying pitifUlly there and, then bowing to the feet of Kaikeyi, left the apartment. ->All Ayodhya is distressed to see Shri Rama's chariot departShri rama overcome with grief, touched the feet of his sovereign and bowing down, with Lakshmana and Sita, circumambulated the king. Having taken leave of his sire, Rama with Sita paid reverence to the sorrow-stricken Queen Kausbalya. Having regard to the period of exile, King Dasaratha had bestowed on his daughter-in-law, robes and jewels and ordered arms and mantra-charged weapons, armour and shields to be placed on the chariot. Seeing that all were mounted, Sumantra set the chariot io motion guiding the horses swift as the wind. Rama having started for the Dandaka forest, the whole city, young and old, men and women, soldiers, elephants and horses, distracted and full of iodigoation and distress, became as beiogs demented. The loosing of elephants, and the loud neighing of horses filled Ayodhya with tumult and ferment. Young and old, distraught,ranafter the chariot of Rama as men overpowered by the sun plunge into water.->Shri Rama,with Sita and Lakshmana and the charioteer drive on alone to the forest Shri Rama, reaching the beautiful banks of the river Tamasa, gazing on Sita, addressed his brother Lakshmana :  O Son of Queen Sumitta, this is the first night of our exile, there is no cause for anxiety. The forest looks deserted and melancholy, the birds and beasts having mired to rest. Doubtless the capital of Ayodhya with its inhabilllnts and my royal sire are deeply distressed on aa:ount of our departure. The king, seeing in us many virtnes, looks on us with deep affection. O Lakshmana, I fear lest my father and my illustrious mother become blind with incessant weeping. Yet Prince Bharats of uprigbt c:onduct, will assuredly offer consolation to my parents in dutiful and pious words. O Mighty-armed Prince, reflecting on the compassion of Prince Bharata, I have no fear for my parents. O Hero, thou bast done well in accompanying me to the forest, bad it not been so, my solicitude for Sits would have been great. 0 Lakshmaua, there is au abundance of roots, fruits and berries here, but to-night I desire to partske of water alone.->Overborne by grief the king yields up his life The king, grieving over the separation from his son, continued to describe the infamous deed.The king weeping and overcome with fear on the approach of death, spoke again :  O Kaushalya, I am about to yield up my life through grief for my son, I am unable to see thee, do thou draw near and touch me.  Those about to enter the abode of death distinguish nought. If Rama could but touch me for an instant, or receive my wealth and the regency, I might yet live. O Auspicious Lady, I have not dealt justly with Rama, but what he has done to me is right. What thoughtful man would abandon even a sinfUl son ? But what son, sent into exile will not think ill of his father ? O Kaushalya, I no longer behold thee, my memory is also fading.",

            "Kishkindkha-Kanda":"Hanuman's meeting with Rama at the command of the magnanimous Sugriva, Hanuman, with one bound, left the Mountain Rishyamuka and placed himself in the path of the two Raghavas.Approaching those two heroes, that Foremost of Monkeys praised them as they deserved, offering them every courtesy and in accord with Sugriva's wish spoke graciously to them.On this, Saumitri addressed that eloquent minister of Sugriva's in well-chosen words, saying :- O Sage, we have been told of the great attributes of Sugriva and are at this moment looking for that King uf the Monkeys. That which he commands we will carry out on thine insttuctions, O Excellent Hanuman. When he heard this gracious speech, that monkey, born of Pavana, who wished nothing more than that Sugriva should triumph, resolved to bring about a friendly alliance between Rama and his master. ->Sugriva consoles ramaThus, in his distress, did Rama speak, and the monkey, Sugriva, with joined palms, weeping, his voice shaken with sobs, answered him, saying :- Indeed I do not know where that wicked titan dwells, nor his strength, nor the extent of his valour, nor the tribe to which that vile monster belongs, but, O Subduer of Thy Foes, I beg thee in all sincerity to master thy grief.   O Sugriva, thou dost fulfil the role of a devoted friend, that of being of service with dignity. O Friend, see how, through thy good counsel, I have become myself again. It is not easy to find such an ally, who is suffering the same adversity; therefore exert thyself to find Maithili and the cruel titan,that perverse Ravana, and tell me frankly what I should do. Thou art a rich field that the rains have visited ; everything will succeed with thee. Further, the words I recently pronounced' with confidence, O Tiger among Monkeys, will without doubt come to pass. Never have I uttered a falsehood, nor shall I ever do so. I swear by the truth, that what I have said will come to pass I  Hearing the words of that King of Men, the wise leader of the valiant monkeys felt in his heart that his purpose was accomplished.->Lakshmana goes to KishkindhaTHE offspring of that lndra among Men, the son of a king, then spoke to his eldex brothex, who, full of tenderness, cheerless, despite his natural gaiety and full of distress.Then Rama, the Destroyer of Warriors, in terms that were prudent and appropriate, addressed Lakshrnana, who bow in hand desired to follow up his words with action and who full of ire was burning to fight : Nay, thine equals in this world do not commit such an outrage,the warrior who nobly masteis his anger, is the greatest of heroes. Do not belie thy natural integrity, O  Lakshmana ! Recollect the feelings of joy that the alliance with Sugriva formerly aroused in thee. Speak to him in moderate tones, omitting all harsh expressions, regarding his delay and his tardiness. lakshmana, who was enraged, recognized that Kishkindha, filled with these monkeys, who were armed with trunks of trees and endowed with great valour, was dillicult of access. And emerging from the walls and ditches, these monkeys stood courageously in the open field.In the face of Sugriva's debauched indifference and the provocative attitude of the monkeys, the valiant lakshmana, guardian of the interests of his elder brother, was seized with fresh anger, and that lion among men, heaving deep and burning sighs, his glances flashing with fury, resembled a brazier belching forth smoke. ->Sugriva sends his monkeys to the east in search of sita.Then the Lord of the Monkeys, his purpose accomplished, said to that lion among men, Rarna, the destroyer of hostile hosts :Here, gathered together, are the foremost of monkeys inhabiting my dominions, who are equal to Mabendra and are able to transpnrt themselves anywhere at will. These ferocious monkeys, resembling giants and titans, of immeasurable prowess, renowned for their exploits, bellicose, valiant, indefatigable and supremely sagacious in all their deliberations, have come with their vast forces. O Rama, these untold millions, who inhabit varinus mountain tracts, traversing land and sea, have come to place themselves at thy service. All are intent on their master's welfare and obedient to thy behests ; they are at thy command, it is for thee to dispose of them as thou wilt. Though I am fully conversant with thy design, yet do thou order all as thou judgest best.-> Hanuman prepares to go to Lanka Seeing that extremely agile leader of monkeys stretching himself in preparation for crossing the four hundred miles of sea, the monkeys, renouncing all despondency, were filled with delight and began to shout and praise the heroism of Hanuman. And, struck with amazement, beings from every sphere rejoiced unitedly, even as when they beheld the Lord Himself displaying his powers, when taking the three strides. Thus acclaimed, the mighty Hanuman expanded in size and waved his tail in pleasure, demonstrating his strength. Applauded by the older monkeys and tilled with energy, he assumed an unparalleled shape, like a lion that stretches himself at the mouth of a rocky cavern, and that Son of Maruta began to yawn and the mouth of that intelligent monkey resembled a blazing brazier or a smokeless fire. Its spacious uplands were deserted by the. pairs of Gandharvas engaged in drinking and dalliance, the birds flew away and the hands of Vidyadharas 1led from the high plateaus ; the huge serpents hid themselves in terror and the cliJfs and spars broke away. With its serpents hissing, their bodies half issuing from their holes, the mountain shone, as if decorated by pennants. The Rishis in fear and agitation 1led from that support of the earth so that it resembled a wayfarer in a vast forest, deserted by his companions. And that agile and valiant monkey, endowed with great speed, the destroyer of his foes, filled with an exalted purpose, had already reached Lanks in thought.",
            "Sundara-Kanda":"Sita sees Hanuman BEHOLDING that monkey of pleasing speech, clad in white raiment, resembling a flash of lighming, crouching concealed among the branches, bright as a cluster of Ashoka flowers and like gold refined in the crucible, Sita was greatly agitated. Observing that foremost of monkeys of humble mien, Maithili said to herself in extreme surprise: Ah ! What a terrible looking monkey, unacceptable and hideous to behold. Thinking thus, her fears increased and she broke into countless plaintive lamentations. Then tbe lovely Sita cried out in her terror :  0 Rama, 0 Rama, 0 Lakshmana !  and the voice of that virtuous princess grew fainter and fainter till, casting her eyes on that excellent monkey once more, who had assumeii a reverent attitude, Maithili said to herself: It must be a dream.Observing the face of that lndra among Monkeys with its deep scars as has been described and, looking on that excellent ape, the most honourable son of the Wind, the first of the wise, Sita lost consciousness and became like one dead. Thereafter, slowly regaining her senses, she said to herself:  This vision of a monkey is condemned by the scriptuses and is an inauspicious dream! Can aU be well with Rama, who is accompanied by Lakshmana and my father King Janaks ? Yet it can be no dream for, in the grief and misfortune that overwhelms me, I am no longer able to sleep and, far from him whose countenance resembles the full moon, no joy remains for me. Through conatantly thinking and calling on Rama, I imagine I hear and see only those things which are related to Rama. For my love is a torment, my whole being flowstowards him, ever absorbed in his rememberance I see and hear him alone. Is it an illusion ? This is what perturbs me and makes me uneasy. I deem this to be but a phantom of the mind yet thinking thus, I still behold it, while an imaginary object can nevet have a form and he who is thus addressing me has a distinct form. Salutations to Vachaspati who is accompanied by the God who bears the Thunderbolt ! Salutations to Swyambhu and the God who partakes of offerings !May they grant that the creature who has spoken in my presence, be real and not illusory! ->Sita gives Hanuman her JeWel HIGHLY gratified by Sita's words, that lion among monkeys answered thus :- 0 Fair Lady of auspicious presence, thou hast spoken in accord with thy feminine nature and with tbe modesty of one devoted to her lord ! As a woman, it would not be possible for thee to cross the sea, four hundred miles in width on my back and the plea that thou hast made, saying 'I may not touch the body of any save Rama' is worthy of thee, 0 Goddess, consort of that magnanimous One. Who but thou would utter such words, O Janaki? Truly Kakutstha shall hear from beginning to end all thou hast said and done in my presence, O Princess. For many reasons did I speak to thee thus, 0 Lady, anxious as I was to compass Rama's design, and my heart troubled with feelings of affection. Further it was with great difficulty that I penetrated into the City of Lanka and traversed the ocean and debating what was meet for me to do, I addressed thee in this wise. I wished to bring thee back to the one who is the delight of tbe House of Raghu this day ! It was my devotion for him and in regard for thee, that I uttered those words. As, however, thou art unable to come with me, 0 Irreproachable Lady, do thou give me some token which will inspire Rama with faith in me.I have but one month to live, 0 Son of Dasaratha I After that month I shall die ; I swear to thee that this is the truth I speak ! Deliver me from the hands of that cruel and wicked Ravana, 0 Hero, as Kaushiki was delivered from hell '. Saying this, Sita drew from her robe the pearl which formerly adorned her forehead, which shone with celestial radiance, and bestowing it on Hanuman, said :  Give this to Raghava.",
            "Lanka-Kanda":"The Army crosses the Sea THEREAPTER the Prince of the Raghus addressed the Ocean in menacing tones, saying:-To-day I shall dry up the sea with the nether regions ! 0 Sagara, with thy waters consumed by my shafts, thy denizens slain by my blows, a gteat cloud of dust will arise from thy drained bed and the monkeys will cross to the othet shore on foot! Thou hast sougbt to oppose me but att unaware of my valour or my strength ! O Abode of the Danavas, being full of pride, thou canst not forcscc thy fate !  Thereafter, fixing an arrow resembling the Rod of Brahma and placing it on his excellent bow, Raghava stretched that weapon, and heaven and earth sccmcd to be riven, as it were, and the mountains trembled, darkness covered the earth and all the regions were obscured. Tremors ran througb the lakes and rivers ; the sun, moon and stars swerved in their course and though the sky was lit by the sun's rays, it was enveloped in darkness and blazed with a hundred mcrcors, whilst thunder reverberated with an unparalleled sound in the firmament. The five celestial Maruts blew and like massed legions tore up the trees, dispersing the clouds in the twinkling of an eye, breaking off the points of the rocks and shattering the mountain peaks. In the sky, loud thunder clapa resounded with immense power and tumult. The invisible beings emitted cries of fear and, lying prostrate on the earth in their agony, sbook with terror, convulsed and unable to move. Thereafter the Ocean with ita mass of water, serpents and demons surged beyond its confines to the ment of a league, though the time of the final deluge was not yet at hand ; nevertheless Rama, the descendant of Raghu, scourge of his foes, did not rcttest before the disordered heavings of that Lord of Rivers and Streams!->Lanka is set on fire by the MonkeysAT that moment, Sugriva, the illustrious King of the Monkeys, addressed Hanuman in words fraught with wisdom, saying :- Now that Kumbhakama bas been slain and the youthful princes have perished, Ravana can no longer harm us I Therefore let those valiant and agile Plavamgamas, who are able to do so, hurl themselves on Lanka with torches in their hands I  Meanwhile the sun had withdrawn behind the Astachala Mountains and at the dread hour of night, the foremost of the monkeys approached Lanka with flaming ton:hes and those simian ranks, furnished with fiery brands, rushed in on all sides so that the grim-visaged titan sentinels instantly fted away. Then the monkeys joyfully set fire to gates, pavilions, highways and byways and buildings of every kind, and the dwellings were consumed by thousands, and the public monuments, as high as mountains, toppled down and fell to earth ; all was consigned to the ftames! Sands! of great price, pearls, brilliant jewels, diamonds and coral, woollen cloths, rich silks, carpets of many kinds made of Iambs wool, vases and weapons of gold, countless rare objects, harness and horse cloths, collars and girths for elephants, chariots with their furnishings and decorations, warrior's armour, trappings for their mounts, swords, bows and bow-strings, arrows, spears, goads and lances, cloths of wool and horsehair, tiger skins, innumerable perfumes, palaces enriched with pearls and precious gems, with stores of arms of every kind, all were burnt to ashes. And the fire consumed all the buildings with their ornamentation and devoured the dwellings of the titans who inhabited them. Clad in armour encrusted with gold, decorated with garlands and other ornaments, their eyes wild with inebriation, wine caused those inhabitants of Lanka to reel as they walked, whilst courtesans clung to their apparel, and they were incensed with tiny against their foes. Armed with maces, picks and swords, they were gorging themselves with meat and drink or sleeping on sumptuous beds with the objects of their desire.Full of terror they fled distrscted, carrying their sons with them in all haste, whilst their luxurious and splendid mansions, which combined every comfon, were consumed by fire in hundreds and thousands on every side. Those golden buildings that seemed to touch the skies constructed like moons and crescents with their magnificent upper galleries, their trellised windows and terraces decorated with pearls and crystal, re-echoed to the cries of herons, peacocks and the tinkling of ornaments. ->Rama and Ravana fight with magic WeaponsBEHOLDING Mahodara and Mahapanhwa slain and, despite his great strength, the valiant Virupskshaalso struck down, a great rage seized Ravana, who urged on his charioteet with these words:-By slaying Rama and Lakshmana I shall remove that double scourge, the cause of the slaughter of my faithful adhetents and the siege of the city. In the fight I shall cut down Rama, that tree of which Sita is the 1lower and the fruit, whose btanches are Sugriva, Jambavan, Kumuda, NaJa, also Dvivida, Mainda, Angada, Gandhamadana, Hanuman, Sushena and all the leading monkeys. Thereupon that mighty car-warrior, who caused the ten regions to resound, drove rapidly on Raghsva with his chariot, and the earth, with its rivers, mountaius and woods, trembled with the uproar, and the lions, gazeUes and birds that inhabited it were seized with terror. Then Ravana employed a dark and magic weapon that was formidable and terrifying and with it he consumed the monkeys, who lied hither and thither. Amidst the dust raised by their battalions, for they were unable to endure that weapon created  by Brahma himself, Raghsva, seeing those countless divisions taking refuge in innumerable places, pursued by Ravana's powerful shafts, stood ready waiting. Meanwhile that Tiger among the Titans, having routed the army of monkeys, beheld Rama standing there unconquered with his brother Lakshmana, like unto Vasava with Vishnu, and Rama seemed to touch the sky as it were as he stretched his great bow and those heroes with eyea as large as lotus petals were long-armed and the conquerors of their foes. From his side the extremely illustrious and valiant Rama, who was accompanied by Saumitri, seeing Ravana overwhelming the monkeys in the fight, joyfully took hold of the centre of his bow and immediately began to bend that czcellent weapon that was stout and sonorous, riving the earth as it were.->The Death of RavanaPrompted by Matali, Rama took up a 1laming shaft that was hissing like a viper, formerly bestowed on him by the magnanitnous and powerful Sage Agastys. A gift of the Grandsire, that  weapon never missed its target and it had been created of yore by Brahma for Indra and bestowed on the King uf the Gods for the conquest of the Three Worlds. In its wings was the wind, in its point the fire and the sun, in its haft space, and, in siEe, it resembled the Mountains Meru and Mandara. With its marvellous point, haft and gilding, it was composed of the essence of all the elements and was as resplendent as the sun. Resembling the Fire of Time enveloped in smoke, it was like unto an enortnous snake and was capable of riving men, elephants, bones, gateways, ban and even roc:b. Dreadful to behold, COVeted ith blood from countless victims, coated with their flesh and of the temper of lightning, it emitted a thunderous sound.The blessed Rsghava, by slaying that Bull among the Titans, fulfilled the ambitions of Sugriva, Angada and Bibishana; peace reigned over all ; tbe cardinal points were stilled ; the air became pure, the earth ceased to tremble, the wind blew gently and the star of the day regained its full glory. At that instant, Sugriva, Bibishana and Angada, the foremost of his friends, and Lakshmana also, approached that happy conqueror and joyfully offered him due homage. Rsma, the delight of the House of Rsghu, surrounded by his adhercnll on the battlefield, having slain his adversary by hia emaurdinary power, resembled Mahendra amidst the Celestial Host.",
            "Uttara-Kanda":"TThe Supreme Virte of the ramanaya.This then is the whole of the great epic and its sequel called the Ramayana, which was composed by Valmiki and is revered by Brahma Himself.The Lord Vishnu returned to Svargaloka as erstwhile, He Who pervades the Three Worlds and all they contain, both the moving and the fixed. Gods, Gandharvas, Siddhas and great Rishis in heaven, ever listen with ddight to the poem 'Ramayana'. This epic, which promotes long life, grants good fortune and destroys sin, is equal to the Veda and should be recited by the wise to men of faith. On hearing it, he who has no son will obtain a son, he who has no fortune will become wealthy ; to read but a foot of this poem will absolve him from all sin. He who commits sins daily will be wholly purified by reciting a single slob. The reciter of this narrative should be rewarded with raiment, cows and gold, for, if he is satisfied, all the Gods are satisfied.  He who recites this epic 'Ramayana' that prolongs life, will be blessed with his sons and grandsons in this world and after his death, in the other world. He who, with devotion, recites the 'Ramayana' at the hour when the cows are loosed or at noon or at dusk, will never sulfer adversity. The enchanting City of Ayodhya, having remained deserted for countless years, will be re-peopled by a Prince named Rishabha. This narrative, that grants longevity, with the 'Bhavishya' and 'Uttara', whose author is the son ofPracetas, has the approval of Brahma Himself.",
